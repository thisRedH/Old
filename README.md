In the second quarter of 2021, I started my programming journey with a project called Rando. It was my first step into the world of coding. Earlier, I've experimented with Unity projects and tried creating small Minecraft mods.

Around the beginning of 2022, I discovered Python and wrote my first script, which I named Ascii. In early 2023, I revisited and rebuild it, creating Ascii 2, to see how far I've come.

Looking back at Rando, Ascii, and Ascii 2, I now see several mistakes, that don't meet my current standards. My biggest leap in learning happened between late 2022 and mid 2023 when I started working with C++ and collaborated with a small group on a Discord bot project.

*Disclaimer: I removed some build artifacts and tested if those work. No code was altered after they were made.*
